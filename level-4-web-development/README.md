### Discuss the following points on your Tutor group forum.  

**Q:** How do you read a newspaper? From cover to cover, or looking for specific sections? How do you know how/where to find different sections?

>**A:** I always like to skim the text first and find what's the most relevant content to consume.

**Q:** Compare and contrast how one might read a conventional printed newspaper and an online version of the same newspaper. 
>**A:** I think people back in the days used to read from cover to cover, skipping only the irrelevant material. But the way the new generation is reading tends more towards just getting a grasp of the content since we have an overload of content.

**Q:** What can you do with the online version that would be difficult or impossible with the paper version? Give examples from the newspaper that you chose.
>**A:** It's hard to highlight some online texts for future reference. As well as reading back to back since there's so much news on it.

**Q:** What advantages do you think the paper version has over the online version?
>**A:** Maybe it prevents you from reading something outdated and helps you with a daily pack of informations.
